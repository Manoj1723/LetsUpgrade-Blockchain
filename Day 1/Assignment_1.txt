Question 1: What is your understanding of Blockchain?
          => Blockchain is a mixed technology which consist Distributed Database and cryptography.
             By using blockchain we can make  1.Verifiable  2.Unchanged  3.Temper proof  4.Immutable informations.
  

Question 2: What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?
          => Blockchain is used to solve  1.Authenticity   2.Security  3.Need of powerful third party for trust


Question 3: What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?
          => Features provided by blockchain are:
             1.Anti-hacking
             2.Gives security boost
             3.Verifiable information’s
             4.Transparency in the data
             5.Data is immutable
             6.Decentralized 

Question 4: What all things does a Block contain?
          => Blockchain clock contains:
             1.Block Number
             2.Transaction record
             3.Previous Block signature
             4.Mining key


Question 5: How is the verifiability of Blockchain has been attained?
          => In blockchain data is stored in decentralized manner, which means data is stored in different blocks and all the blocks are connected.
             If data is changed in one block then signature of all blocks will change .
             By this way data can’t be manipulated and gives the verifiability to the data.
